## Mod Content

Quicksand generates in Deserts and acts similarly to Powder Snow. You will sink into Quicksand unless wearing Leather Boots. Once you're submerged you'll start drowning in it! You'll want to escape quickly.

Red Quicksand also exists, and generates in Badlands. It's like Quicksand meets Red Sand. Who knew?

You can pick up Quicksand in Buckets and put it in Cauldrons if you want. Dunno why you'd want to, but you can.

If a Zombie ends up submerged in Quicksand for too long, it becomes a Husk. That's kinda neat, isn't it?

## Changes on Forge
